# Description 

This fitness tracker allows a user to keep track of their workouts and add or remove exercises as they wish. When a workout is completed, a user sees aggregated data representing totals from the exercises they completed during their workout. If a user were to click the dashboard, they would be presented with graphs showing their workout history from the last 7 days.
